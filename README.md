Downloading the git repo locally and creating a virtual environment
*******************************************************************
create a folder where you want to clone the crypto repository or go 
to the local folder where you have all your project directories
cd to this folder and unpack the Crypto project locally
>> cd Repos
>> git clone https://github.com/cryptoroel/Madeira.git

Great, you downloaded the gitup Crypto project in your local Repos directory

Next step is to set up your virtual_environment

for Linux and Mac OS:
>> cd CryptoMadeira  (goes into the local Crypto directory under Repos/Crypto)
>> python3.7 -m venv crypto_env 

Activate this virtual environment:
>> source crypto_env/bin/activate

Install all the package from the myCryptoInstall.txt
>> pip install -r requirements.txt

How to push into the git project:
git push https://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@github.com/cryptoroel/Madeira.git
